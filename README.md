This repository houses a number of my computer vision projects.

All models trained with their respective projects are uploaded on my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pythonistasamurai/models).  
 
Several of my advanced computer vision projects, such as object detection, segmentation, and key points regression, have videos showcasing their output. If you're interested, check out my [portfolio](https://haroonrashid-portfolio.streamlit.app/).
